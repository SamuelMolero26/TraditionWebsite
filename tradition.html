                                <p>On <i>January 2, 1992</i>, during the <a href = "https://12thman.com/sports/2015/8/4/FB_0804153846" > <u> Dixie Classic in Dallas </u> </a>, the Texas A&M football team faced the heavily favored Centre College Praying Colonels. Plagued with Injuries, Aggie's were left with only 11 players, 
                                    and were struggling to keep up. Rapidly the bench became empty, 
                                    but as Coach Dana X. looked across the stands, he remembered about Gill.</p>
                                <p>Gill was quickly brought down to the sidelines and was told to suit up. Returning to the sidelines, Gill stood up ready to play for the entirety of the game in case the 11 men left needed assistance, 
                                    earning the title of “12th man”.  Aggie's won the 22-14, and Gill remained the only player left on the bench; not only at the service of his team, but most importantly at the service of his community.</p>
